# AWS SageMaker Ground Truth - Build Highly Accurate Datasets and Train Them with ML models
Amazon SageMaker can make it easy for customers to to efficiently and accurately label the datasets required for training machine learning systems.

Labeling datasets is a critical phase of training any supervised machine learning models. Data scientists and developers can now easily train machine learning models on datasets labeled by Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth. Amazon SageMaker Training now accepts the labeled datasets produced in augmented manifest format as input through both AWS Management Console.
